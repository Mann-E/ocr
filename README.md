# Mann-E OCR

This is a continuation of the [Persian OCR Project](https://github.com/prp-e/persian_ocr_project) which has been started a few years ago by [Muhammadreza Haghiri](https://haghiri75.com/en) as an effort to bring a reliable and open-source _Optical Character Recognition_ or _OCR_ software to life for Persian speakers. 

The initial goal of this project is for Persian speakers, but even at this step, it can be quite useful for all the people who use the same set of alphabet.
