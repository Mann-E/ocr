# Mann-E OCR

This is a continuation of the [Persian OCR Project](https://github.com/prp-e/persian_ocr_project) which has been started a few years ago by [Muhammadreza Haghiri](https://haghiri75.com/en) as an effort to bring a reliable and open-source _Optical Character Recognition_ or _OCR_ software to life for Persian speakers.
